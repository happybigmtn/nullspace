# Reporting Security Issues

We welcome security disclosures and are committed to prompt attention for confirmed issues.

Please report vulnerabilities privately:
- GitHub Security: https://github.com/commonwarexyz/nullspace/security/advisories
- Email: security@nullspace.xyz

We do not currently offer a public bounty program. We may provide discretionary rewards for
critical issues and will credit reporters with permission.
