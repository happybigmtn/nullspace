- CasinoTogggleShield an CasinoToggleDouble only apply in tournaments, so maybe they dont need to be their own isntruction variants, but instead can just be a subset of CasinoGameMove.
-- CasinoSuper is a type of game mode, it also feels like it should be a CasinoGameMove subset.

   1. Zero-Copy Limitations: The code uses Vec<u8> and String
      heavily in Read implementations.
       * Critique: Every time a block is parsed, it allocates
         new memory for every transaction payload and string.
       * Alternative: Using Cow<'a, [u8]> (Copy-on-Write) could
         allow the structs to point directly to the raw byte
         buffer without allocating, speeding up block processing
         significantly during high load.
