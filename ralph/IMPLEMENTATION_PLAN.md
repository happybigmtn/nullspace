    - Programmatic: API tests for admin auth and audit logging
  - Perceptual: None
  - **Completed**: Added admin operations infrastructure:
    - `AuditLogEntry` type (`types/src/casino/economy.rs`): Full audit trail with id, action_type, admin pubkey, timestamp, ip_hash (SHA256), before/after state blobs, reason, block_height, request_id
    - `AuditLogState` type: Aggregate tracking (next_entry_id, total_entries, entries_by_type[8])
    - `AdminActionType` enum: UpdateBankrollLimits, UpdateGameConfig, UpdatePolicy, UpdateResponsibleGamingLimits, ToggleBridge, ToggleOracle, EmergencyAction
    - Key/Value variants: AuditLogState (tag 36), AuditLogEntry(u64) (tag 37)
    - `AdminState` struct in Simulator for in-memory admin state caching
    - Admin auth via `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN` env var with `admin_auth_error()` helper
    - HTTP endpoints (`simulator/src/api/http.rs`):
      - `GET /admin/state` - Get current admin state (bankroll + policy)
      - `GET /admin/audit-logs` - List audit log entries with pagination (offset/limit)
      - `GET /admin/audit-logs/:id` - Get specific audit log entry
      - `POST /admin/limits/bankroll` - Update house bankroll limits (creates audit entry)
      - `POST /admin/config/policy` - Update policy config (creates audit entry)
    - IP hash extraction from X-Forwarded-For for privacy-preserving audit trail
    - Tests: 4 admin tests (load/save bankroll, load/save policy, audit log creation, multiple entries)
