# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-06
Target: Testnet Production

## Codebase Patterns

### Execution Layer (Rust)
- All casino games implement `CasinoGame` trait
- State blob versioning: v2 → v3 → v4 migrations supported
- Deterministic RNG: SHA256 hash-chain from consensus seed
- Event logging: MMR-based append-only with crash recovery
- Tests: 379/379 passing, run with `cargo test`

### Gateway (TypeScript)
- Config validation: `gateway/src/config/validation.ts` rejects placeholders
- CORS: defense-in-depth via `initializeCors()`
- Rate limits: `MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP=200`, `MAX_TOTAL_SESSIONS=20000`
- Metrics: Bearer token auth required on `/metrics`
- Global table: `GATEWAY_LIVE_TABLE_CRAPS=1` enables Craps coordinator

### Mobile (React Native)
- Crypto: Ed25519 signing, PBKDF2 key derivation, AES-GCM storage
- WebSocket: Exponential backoff 1s → 30s, max 10 attempts
- 12 race conditions identified (see US-005 through US-009, US-021-022)
- Tests: 222/222 unit tests, run with `npm test`

### Configuration
- Production configs: `configs/production/*.env.example`
- Staging configs: `configs/staging/*.env.example`
- Preflight validation: `scripts/preflight-management.mjs`
- Bootstrap: `./scripts/bootstrap-testnet.sh` generates node YAML

### Testing Scripts
- Bet coverage: `RUN_INTEGRATION=true pnpm -C gateway exec vitest run tests/all-bet-types.test.ts`
- Soak test: `./scripts/soak-test.sh configs/testnet 4`
- Bot load: `./scripts/run-bots.sh configs/testnet http://<HOST>:8080`
- Global table: `node scripts/load-test-global-table.mjs`

## 2026-01-06 - Initial PRD Setup

- Created prd.json with 40 user stories for testnet production
- Stories organized by priority:
  - Priority 1-4: Blocking infrastructure inputs
  - Priority 5-11: Critical mobile race conditions + security
  - Priority 12-15: Integration and load testing
  - Priority 16-20: Monitoring and smoke checks
  - Priority 21-30: Additional fixes and recovery drills
  - Priority 31-40: Documentation, optimization, production build
- **Learnings:**
  - Execution layer is 95% ready (379/379 tests pass)
  - Gateway/Node production-ready with config validation
  - Mobile has 12 race conditions needing fixes
  - Go/No-Go criteria in runbook Section 10

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-002: Generate metrics auth token

- What was implemented:
  - Verified `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN=SLNmUmUHvNzc+wUagF9aOPGaQBb1DNp8jSG75+Cq5uI=` already set in all 3 production configs (gateway, node, simulator)
  - Generated new secure tokens for remaining placeholders
  - Updated `GATEWAY_LIVE_TABLE_PRESENCE_TOKEN` in gateway.env.example
  - Updated `GLOBAL_TABLE_PRESENCE_TOKEN` in simulator.env.example (same value as gateway for coordination)
  - Updated `SIMULATOR_IDENTITY` in simulator.env.example
- Files changed:
  - `configs/production/gateway.env.example` - line 33: presence token
  - `configs/production/simulator.env.example` - lines 8 (identity) and 44 (presence token)
- **Learnings:**
  - `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` must be shared across all services for Prometheus scraping
  - Presence tokens (`GATEWAY_LIVE_TABLE_PRESENCE_TOKEN` / `GLOBAL_TABLE_PRESENCE_TOKEN`) must match for live table coordination
  - `SIMULATOR_IDENTITY` is unique per instance for P2P identification
  - Preflight script validates additional configs beyond just tokens (CORS, admin keys)

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-001: Remove committed .env secrets from website

- What was implemented:
  - VERIFIED FALSE POSITIVE: .env, .env.local, .env.network were never committed to git
  - Root `.gitignore` lines 18-19 already exclude `.env` and `.env.*` (with exceptions for `.example`)
  - `git check-ignore -v website/.env*` confirms all 3 files are being ignored
  - `git log --all -- website/.env*` shows no commit history for these files
- Files changed:
  - None - existing configuration was already correct
- **Learnings:**
  - Always verify findings with `git ls-files` and `git log --all` before taking action
  - Root `.gitignore` in nullspace properly covers all subpackages (website, mobile, gateway)
  - `git check-ignore -v <file>` shows which `.gitignore` rule is matching a file
  - `VITE_IDENTITY` is a 192-char hex keypair used by `WasmWrapper` for crypto operations

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-004: Add security headers to website nginx.conf

- What was implemented:
  - Added Content-Security-Policy to both nginx.conf (dev) and nginx.ssl.conf (prod)
  - CSP allows: 'self', 'wasm-unsafe-eval', Google Fonts, WebSocket connections
  - Added X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY, Referrer-Policy
  - HSTS was already in nginx.ssl.conf (max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload)
  - Added Cache-Control headers for static assets with "immutable" for fingerprinted files
- Files changed:
  - `website/nginx.conf` - Added all security headers + cache control
  - `website/nginx.ssl.conf` - Added CSP header + cache control sections
- **Learnings:**
  - `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is the modern CSP directive for WebAssembly (replaces `'unsafe-eval'`)
  - Vite fingerprints JS/CSS in `/assets/` dir, enabling `immutable` caching (1 year)
  - Dev nginx.conf uses `ws:` in connect-src while prod uses only `wss:` for security
  - nginx `add_header` in location blocks doesn't inherit from parent - must repeat X-Content-Type-Options
  - Google Fonts requires whitelisting both fonts.googleapis.com (CSS) and fonts.gstatic.com (WOFF2 files)

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-005: Fix mobile setState after unmount race

- What was implemented:
  - Added `isMounted` useRef flag to 6 game screens that use InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions
  - Cleanup effect sets `isMounted.current = false` on unmount
  - Guard `if (!isMounted.current) return;` added before setState in InteractionManager callbacks
  - Verified other 4 screens (Baccarat, Craps, Roulette, SicBo) don't have the issue
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/BlackjackScreen.tsx` - Added isMounted ref + guard
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/HiLoScreen.tsx` - Added isMounted ref + guard
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/VideoPokerScreen.tsx` - Added isMounted ref + guard
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/CasinoWarScreen.tsx` - Added isMounted ref + guard
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/ThreeCardPokerScreen.tsx` - Added isMounted ref + guard
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/UltimateTXHoldemScreen.tsx` - Added isMounted ref + guard
- **Learnings:**
  - `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions()` defers work until animations complete - can fire after unmount
  - Pattern: `const isMounted = useRef(true); useEffect(() => () => { isMounted.current = false }, []);`
  - Check `isMounted.current` before any setState in deferred callbacks
  - React Native useRef doesn't cause re-renders - ideal for tracking mount state
  - Only 6 of 10 game screens used InteractionManager - the others process messages synchronously

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-006: Fix double WebSocket reconnect race

- What was implemented:
  - Added `isReconnectingRef` useRef to websocket.ts to track in-flight connections
  - Guard at start of `connect()` checks ref, logs skip in DEV, returns early if already connecting
  - Clear flag in onopen, onclose, and catch blocks
  - Exposed `isReconnecting` in WebSocketManager interface
  - Updated useWebSocketReconnectOnForeground to check isReconnecting before calling reconnect()
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/services/websocket.ts` - Added isReconnectingRef + guards
  - `mobile/src/hooks/useWebSocketReconnectOnForeground.ts` - Check isReconnecting before reconnect
- **Learnings:**
  - Race occurs when: background→foreground trigger + auto-reconnect timeout fire simultaneously
  - Solution: Use ref (not state) to track connection in progress - refs update synchronously
  - Clear flag on both success (onopen) and failure (onclose, catch) paths
  - Expose flag in interface so consumers can check before triggering reconnect
  - Changed console.warn to console.log with __DEV__ guard for cleaner prod logs

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-007: Fix stale balance in useChipBetting hook

- What was implemented:
  - Changed placeChip callback to use `useGameStore.getState().balance`
  - Removed `balance` from useCallback dependency array since it's read synchronously inside
  - This ensures balance check uses current server value, not stale closure
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/hooks/useChipBetting.ts` - Fixed balance read in placeChip
- **Learnings:**
  - Zustand's `getState()` returns current store state synchronously (no re-render needed)
  - Using `useStore()` in hook body + closure capture = stale if rapid updates
  - Pattern: For values that must be fresh inside callbacks, use `store.getState().value`
  - This is especially important for financial values like balance where stale checks = overdrafts

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-008: Add bet submission debouncing

- What was implemented:
  - Created new `useBetSubmission` hook to centralize submission debouncing
  - Hook provides: `isSubmitting`, `submitBet(message)`, `clearSubmission()`
  - 5-second timeout fallback re-enables buttons if server doesn't respond
  - Integrated into all 10 game screens (Blackjack, HiLo, VideoPoker, CasinoWar, ThreeCardPoker, UltimateTXHoldem, Baccarat, Roulette, SicBo, Craps)
  - Also fixed websocket.test.tsx to expect console.log instead of console.warn (from US-006 change)
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/hooks/useBetSubmission.ts` - New hook created
  - `mobile/src/hooks/index.ts` - Export new hook
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/*.tsx` - All 10 game screens updated
  - `mobile/src/services/__tests__/websocket.test.tsx` - Fixed test expectation
- **Learnings:**
  - Centralized hooks > per-screen state for cross-cutting concerns like submission tracking
  - Pattern: `submitBet()` returns boolean so caller knows if submission was accepted
  - `clearSubmission()` should be called in useEffect when server responds (game_started, game_move, game_result)
  - Timeout fallback is safety net - don't rely on it, but it prevents permanent button disable on network issues
  - Tests matter: the console.log/warn change from US-006 broke a test, caught immediately by running test suite

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-009: Add DEV guards to console statements

- What was implemented:
  - Added `if (__DEV__)` guards to all debug/info console statements in mobile services
  - websocket.ts: 12 console statements wrapped (logs, warns, errors)
  - storage.ts: 2 console.warn statements wrapped (SecureStore auth fallback info)
  - useAppState.ts: 3 console.warn statements wrapped (storage init/persist/restore failures)
  - crypto.ts: 2 console statements wrapped (decryption failure, vault requirement)
  - errorReporter.ts: Left UNCHANGED - the console.error/warn wrapping is intentional telemetry infrastructure
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/services/websocket.ts` - 12 __DEV__ guards added
  - `mobile/src/services/storage.ts` - 2 __DEV__ guards added
  - `mobile/src/hooks/useAppState.ts` - 3 __DEV__ guards added
  - `mobile/src/services/crypto.ts` - 2 __DEV__ guards added
- **Learnings:**
  - `__DEV__` is a React Native global that's `true` in development, `false` in production
  - Guards completely remove console calls from production bundle (dead code elimination)
  - Distinguish between debug logging (guard it) vs. error telemetry infrastructure (don't guard it)
  - The pattern `if (__DEV__) { console.x(...) }` is idiomatic in React Native
  - errorReporter.ts wraps console.error/warn to intercept and report - this is infrastructure, not debug logging

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-001: Configure production CORS and backend URLs

- What was implemented:
  - Replaced ambiguous `example.com` placeholder URLs with clearly-named `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_*` placeholders
  - Added missing `GATEWAY_ORIGIN` config (required for nonce signing)
  - Added `GATEWAY_LIVE_TABLE_CRAPS=1` and admin key file configuration
  - Updated all three production config files (gateway, simulator, ops)
  - Verified all configs pass `scripts/preflight-management.mjs` validation
- Files changed:
  - `configs/production/gateway.env.example` - Added GATEWAY_ORIGIN, replaced BACKEND_URL/ALLOWED_ORIGINS placeholders, added live table config
  - `configs/production/simulator.env.example` - Replaced db/redis/CORS placeholders
  - `configs/production/ops.env.example` - Replaced OPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS placeholder
- **Learnings:**
  - `.env.example` files should use obviously-fake placeholders that operators MUST replace
  - `GATEWAY_ORIGIN` is the gateway's public URL, used for nonce signing - distinct from `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
  - `GATEWAY_LIVE_TABLE_ADMIN_KEY_FILE` must point to hex-encoded Ed25519 key for global table bet signing
  - Preflight script (`scripts/preflight-management.mjs`) validates required keys but not placeholder content
  - Runtime validation in `gateway/src/config/validation.ts` rejects values containing 'example' in production

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-002: Add timeout to website API fetch calls

- What was implemented:
  - Added 10-second AbortController timeout to `explorerClient.ts` getJson() function
  - Created `FetchTimeoutError` custom error class for typed timeout handling
  - Added JSON parsing error handling with user-friendly message
  - Added timeout to `client.js` in 4 locations:
    - `submitTransaction()` - POST transaction submissions
    - `queryState()` - State queries (inside retry loop)
    - `querySeed()` - Seed queries by view (inside retry loop)
    - `queryLatestSeed()` - Latest seed queries
  - All timeouts use consistent `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000` constant
- Files changed:
  - `website/src/api/explorerClient.ts` - Added AbortController + FetchTimeoutError + JSON try-catch
  - `website/src/api/client.js` - Added FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS constant, AbortController to 4 fetch calls
- **Learnings:**
  - `AbortController` + `signal` is the standard browser way to timeout fetch requests
  - Always `clearTimeout()` on both success AND error paths to avoid memory leaks
  - In retry loops, create new AbortController per iteration (can't reuse aborted controller)
  - Check `error.name === 'AbortError'` to distinguish timeout from network failure
  - `queryLatestSeed` returns `{ found: false }` on timeout (graceful degradation) while critical paths throw

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-003: Add JSON validation to explorer API responses

- What was implemented:
  - Created `ResponseValidationError` custom error class for typed error handling
  - Implemented 5 type guard functions:
    - `isExplorerBlock()` - validates block fields (height, view, block_digest, tx_hashes, tx_count, indexed_at_ms)
    - `isExplorerTransaction()` - validates tx fields (hash, block_height, position, public_key, nonce, instruction)
    - `isAccountActivity()` - validates account fields (public_key, txs, events)
    - `isBlocksResponse()` - validates paginated blocks list with .every() check
    - `isSearchResponse()` - validates discriminated union by type field
  - Updated all 5 public functions to validate response before returning
  - Each validation failure logs raw response with console.error for debugging
- Files changed:
  - `website/src/api/explorerClient.ts` - Added 94 lines of validation code
- **Learnings:**
  - Type guards (`(data: unknown): data is T`) provide both runtime safety AND TypeScript narrowing
  - For lightweight validation, type guards are preferable to adding Zod/Yup dependencies
  - Pattern: Cast to `Record<string, unknown>` after null/object check for type-safe property access
  - `Array.isArray(obj.blocks) && obj.blocks.every(isExplorerBlock)` validates array contents efficiently
  - Export the error class so consumers can catch `ResponseValidationError` specifically vs other errors

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-004: Add mobile session expiration

- What was implemented:
  - Added `SESSION_CREATED_AT` storage key for persisting session timestamp
  - Added `sessionExpired` state to AuthContext interface
  - Implemented `isSessionExpired()` helper (24-hour threshold via `SESSION_MAX_AGE_MS`)
  - Implemented `clearSessionStorage()` to clean both session keys
  - Added `checkSessionValidity()` callback that validates and clears expired sessions
  - Added AppState listener for foreground detection (checks expiration on resume)
  - Modified `authenticate()` to store timestamp via `setNumber()`
  - Modified `logout()` to use `clearSessionStorage()` instead of single deleteKey
  - Added 3 tests: login stores timestamp, 25h session expires, 12h session stays valid
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/services/storage.ts` - Added SESSION_CREATED_AT storage key
  - `mobile/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Session expiration logic
  - `mobile/src/context/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx` - Added mock functions and expiration tests
- **Learnings:**
  - AppState pattern: `useRef` for previous state + `addEventListener('change')` for transitions
  - `getNumber(..., 0)` returning 0 means "no timestamp" - treat as legacy session, don't expire
  - `useCallback` with no deps for `checkSessionValidity` since it only uses module-level helpers
  - Mock reset in beforeEach needs default return values set AFTER reset

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-005: Setup Sentry error tracking for mobile

- What was implemented:
  - Installed `@sentry/react-native` v7.8.0 via pnpm
  - Added Sentry.init() in App.tsx with conditional prod-only activation
  - Created ErrorFallback component for Sentry.ErrorBoundary
  - Wrapped app content with Sentry.ErrorBoundary (showDialog enabled)
  - Added EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN and EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT to .env.example
  - Configured 10% tracesSampleRate for performance monitoring
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/App.tsx` - Sentry init + ErrorBoundary + fallback UI
  - `mobile/package.json` - Added @sentry/react-native dependency
  - `mobile/.env.example` - Added Sentry env vars
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated lockfile
- **Learnings:**
  - `if (SENTRY_DSN && !__DEV__)` pattern ensures no Sentry overhead in development
  - ErrorBoundary `showDialog` prop shows native Sentry crash dialog on error
  - ErrorFallback receives `{ resetError }` prop to allow user retry
  - Sentry requires native linking via `npx pod-install` on iOS (handled by Expo)
  - `environment` tag helps filter prod vs staging errors in Sentry dashboard

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-006: Add bearer auth to Prometheus scrape config

- What was implemented:
  - Added `authorization` block with `credentials_file` to all 4 scrape jobs
  - Added missing `gateway` job targeting port 9010 with `/metrics` path
  - Updated docker-compose to mount `metrics_auth_token` file
  - Added `GATEWAY_METRICS_TARGET` env var for host override
  - Created `metrics_auth_token.example` with generation instructions
  - Added `docker/observability/metrics_auth_token` to `.gitignore`
- Files changed:
  - `docker/observability/prometheus.yml` - Added auth + gateway job
  - `docker/observability/docker-compose.yml` - Added volume mount + env var
  - `docker/observability/metrics_auth_token.example` - Setup instructions
  - `.gitignore` - Exclude secret token file
- **Learnings:**
  - Prometheus uses `credentials_file` not `bearer_token` when token is in a file
  - Token file should contain just the raw token value, no formatting
  - `authorization.type: Bearer` + `credentials_file` is the modern Prometheus auth pattern
  - File-based secrets are more secure than env vars in docker-compose (no shell expansion)
  - All services must share the same METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN value for auth to work

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-007: Add auth service failure alert rules

- What was implemented:
  - Added `auth_health` alert group with 2 new rules
  - AuthServiceFailures: rate of failure/error counters > 0.05 for 5m (severity: critical)
  - AuthSyncFailures: rate of freeroll.sync.failure > 0.05 for 5m (severity: warning)
  - Alerts use regex matching on counter keys: `{key=~".*\\.failure|.*\\.error"}`
- Files changed:
  - `docker/observability/alerts.yml` - Added auth_health group with 2 alert rules
- **Learnings:**
  - Auth service uses counter-based metrics, not HTTP status codes
  - Prometheus regex label matching: `{key=~"pattern"}` not `{key~="pattern"}`
  - Escape dots in regex: `\\.failure` not `.failure` (dot is "any char" in regex)
  - Alert naming convention: `<Service><Problem>` e.g., `AuthServiceFailures`
  - Severity: "critical" for service-level issues, "warning" for degraded functionality

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-008: Fix mobile integration test message type expectations

- What was implemented:
  - Updated 9 game integration tests to use `waitForGameOutcome()` instead of `assertMessageReceived('game_result')`
  - `waitForGameOutcome()` correctly handles both `game_move` and `game_result` message types
  - HiLoTest and RouletteTest were already using correct pattern (passed before fix)
  - CasinoWarTest refactored to use `outcome.type === 'move'` for tie detection instead of try/catch
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/BlackjackTest.ts` - 3 methods fixed
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/CrapsTest.ts` - 4 methods fixed
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/BaccaratTest.ts` - 4 methods fixed
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/SicBoTest.ts` - 4 methods fixed
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/VideoPokerTest.ts` - 4 methods fixed
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/CasinoWarTest.ts` - 4 methods refactored (tie detection)
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/ThreeCardTest.ts` - 4 methods fixed
  - `mobile/tests/integration/games/UltimateHoldemTest.ts` - 4 methods fixed (kept game_move for intermediate states)
  - `mobile/tests/integration/.gitignore` - Added to exclude test results
- **Learnings:**
  - Gateway sends `game_move` for atomic games that resolve immediately with state
  - Gateway sends `game_result` for games with explicit end (like fold)
  - `waitForGameOutcome()` uses `Promise.race()` to await either type - already existed in BaseGameTest
  - CasinoWar tie detection: use `outcome.type === 'move'` instead of try/catch timeout pattern
  - Integration tests run via `ts-node tests/integration/runTests.ts` against live gateway

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-009: Web QA bet harness local environment setup

- What was implemented:
  - Created `website/README.md` with comprehensive documentation:
    - Quick start instructions
    - Environment variable reference with explanations
    - QA Bet Harness usage (UI and Playwright automation)
    - Troubleshooting for common errors (CHAIN OFFLINE, Missing VITE_IDENTITY, Vault locked)
    - Local network requirements table
  - Updated `configs/local/.env.local` with all QA testing variables:
    - `VITE_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:9010` (for session-based games)
    - `VITE_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:4000` (for auth service)
    - `VITE_QA_BETS=true` (enables QA harness panel)
    - `VITE_ALLOW_LEGACY_KEYS=true` (for dev without vault)
- Files changed:
  - `website/README.md` - Created with 130+ lines of documentation
  - `configs/local/.env.local` - Added 4 QA-related env vars
- **Learnings:**
  - "CHAIN OFFLINE" error comes from `ensureChainResponsive()` in `useChainTimeouts.ts`
  - `ensureChainResponsive()` checks: (1) cached view, (2) queryLatestSeed, (3) waitForFirstSeed with 1.5s timeout
  - Main README already correctly sets `ALLOWED_WS_ORIGINS` for localhost (lines 80-82)
  - Simulator validates WebSocket origins in `simulator/src/api/ws.rs` via `validate_origin()`
  - Gateway has defense-in-depth CORS in `gateway/src/middleware/security.ts` but allows all in dev mode
  - QA Bet Harness exposes `window.__qa` API for Playwright: `runAllBets()`, `runGameBets(type)`, `getResults()`, `getLogs()`

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-021: Add golden vectors for state parsing (server→client)

- What was implemented:
  - Added `stateParsingVectors` section to `golden-vectors.json` with vectors for all 10 game types
  - Created test file in `packages/game-state/test/game-state.test.ts` that validates parsers against vectors
  - Vectors cover: Blackjack (v4), HiLo, VideoPoker, CasinoWar (v1), Baccarat, Roulette (v2), SicBo, Craps (v2), ThreeCard (v3), UltimateHoldem (v3)
  - Each vector includes expected parsed output and raw hex bytes matching Rust serialization format
  - Tests load vectors and validate parser output matches expected values
- Files changed:
  - `packages/protocol/test/fixtures/golden-vectors.json` - Added stateParsingVectors section
  - `packages/game-state/test/fixtures/golden-vectors.json` - Copy of protocol vectors
  - `packages/game-state/test/game-state.test.ts` - Added golden vector validation tests
- **Learnings:**
  - Rust state serialization uses big-endian byte order for multi-byte values (u64, i64, u32)
  - Blackjack v4 header is 46 bytes: version(1) + stage(1) + 5 side bets(40) + initCards(2) + activeHandIdx(1) + handCount(1)
  - HIDDEN_CARD constant is 0xFF (255) used for unknown/hidden cards
  - HiLo state includes pre-computed multipliers (u32 BE) for next guess options
  - Golden vectors must be generated from exact Rust binary format, not manually approximated

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-024: Add protocol round-trip tests for mobile state decoders

- What was implemented:
  - Created `game-round-trip` Rust binary in `node/src/bin/game_round_trip.rs`
  - Binary initializes game, processes TypeScript-encoded payloads, outputs state blob hex
  - Added TypeScript round-trip test `packages/protocol/test/round-trip.test.ts`
  - Tests cover all 10 game types: Blackjack, Roulette, Craps, Baccarat, SicBo, HiLo, VideoPoker, CasinoWar, ThreeCard, UltimateHoldem
  - Each test: TypeScript encodes → Rust processes → TypeScript decodes state blob
  - Tests verify structural correctness (card counts, dice values, stage values, etc.)
- Files changed:
  - `node/src/bin/game_round_trip.rs` - New Rust binary for round-trip testing
  - `node/Cargo.toml` - Added [[bin]] entry for game-round-trip
  - `packages/protocol/test/round-trip.test.ts` - New TypeScript test file (11 tests)
- **Learnings:**
  - Games have different auto-resolve behaviors: Roulette/Craps/SicBo auto-roll on bet; HiLo/VideoPoker auto-deal
  - ThreeCard Deal is opcode 2, UltimateHoldem Deal is opcode 5 (not 0 like most games)
  - spawnSync is simpler than exec for synchronous binary execution in tests
  - Round-trip tests catch protocol drift that golden vectors alone can't (missing fields, wrong byte order)
  - Binary output is JSON for easy parsing in TypeScript tests

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-023: Fix blocking haptics pattern across all game screens

- What was implemented:
  - Audited all 10 game screens for haptic calls without proper error handling
  - Converted 70+ haptic calls to fire-and-forget pattern: `haptics.xxx().catch(() => {})`
  - Added ESLint rule using `no-restricted-syntax` to catch future violations
  - Rule catches both `await haptics.xxx()` and bare `haptics.xxx()` without `.catch()`
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/SicBoScreen.tsx` - 5 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/HiLoScreen.tsx` - 2 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/BaccaratScreen.tsx` - 7 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/BlackjackScreen.tsx` - 8 haptic calls fixed (already had some)
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/RouletteScreen.tsx` - 4 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/CrapsScreen.tsx` - 8 haptic calls fixed (including void→catch conversion)
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/UltimateTXHoldemScreen.tsx` - 11 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/ThreeCardPokerScreen.tsx` - 7 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/VideoPokerScreen.tsx` - 4 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/CasinoWarScreen.tsx` - 2 haptic calls fixed
  - `mobile/eslint.config.js` - Added no-restricted-syntax rule for haptic pattern enforcement
- **Learnings:**
  - Haptic calls are async but non-critical - using `await` blocks UI if hardware unavailable
  - Fire-and-forget pattern: call without await, add `.catch(() => {})` to swallow Promise rejection
  - This prevents unhandled Promise rejections on devices without haptic hardware (simulators)
  - ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` can match AST patterns to enforce coding conventions
  - Pattern for await detection: `AwaitExpression > CallExpression[callee.object.name='haptics']`
  - Pattern for bare call detection uses `:not(:has(...))` pseudo-selector for method chaining

## 2026-01-06 - US-025: Add storage fallback integration tests

- What was implemented:
  - Added 11 integration tests for storage fallback behavior across MMKV, AsyncStorage, and WebStorage backends
  - Added `_resetStorageForTesting()` function to storage.ts for resetting singleton state between tests
  - Added failure simulation flags to jest/setup.js global mocks (`mmkvShouldThrow`, `secureStoreGetShouldThrow`, etc.)
  - Tests cover: MMKV→AsyncStorage fallback, AsyncStorage init errors, SecureStore errors, tutorial persistence, encryption key generation/reuse
  - Web storage tests use `jest.isolateModules` with `jest.doMock` for platform-specific behavior
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/services/storage.ts` - Added `_resetStorageForTesting()` export function
  - `mobile/jest/setup.js` - Added failure flags to `globalThis.__testMocks__` + conditional throw logic in MMKV, SecureStore, AsyncStorage mocks
  - `mobile/src/services/__tests__/storage.test.ts` - Complete rewrite with 2 describe blocks (integration + web)
- **Learnings:**
  - Jest module caching: Singleton pattern (`let storageInstance`) retains state across tests unless explicitly reset
  - Solution: Export a test-only reset function like `_resetStorageForTesting()` to null the singleton
  - `jest.isolateModules` with `jest.doMock` can corrupt global mock state for later tests
  - Order matters: Run integration tests (using global mocks) BEFORE tests using `isolateModules`
  - Global test mocks via `globalThis.__testMocks__` allow tests to control mock behavior per-test without re-mocking
  - Pattern: `globalThis.__testMocks__.mmkvShouldThrow = true` before calling code under test
  - Dynamic imports (`await import()`) require `--experimental-vm-modules` in Jest - use `require()` instead

## 2026-01-06 - US-026: Add WebSocket reconnection integration tests

- What was implemented:
  - Created `WebSocketReconnectionTest.ts` with 6 comprehensive integration tests
  - Test 1: Session persistence - verifies publicKey remains constant after reconnect (sessionId may change, which is expected)
  - Test 2: Balance consistency - verifies balance unchanged after disconnect/reconnect cycle
  - Test 3: Mid-game disconnect - tests game state recovery or graceful failure with new game capability
  - Test 4: Nonce continuity - verifies transactions work after reconnect by completing games before and after
  - Test 5: Message queue flush - tests messages processed after reconnect
  - Test 6: Rapid reconnections - stress tests 3 rapid reconnect cycles
  - Created `runReconnectionTests.ts` standalone runner for the reconnection test suite
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/tests/integration/framework/WebSocketReconnectionTest.ts` - New test class with 6 tests
  - `mobile/tests/integration/runReconnectionTests.ts` - Standalone runner for reconnection tests
- **Learnings:**
  - Integration tests use real WebSocket connections via `ws` package to actual gateway
  - Session ID changing after reconnect is expected behavior (server creates new session)
  - Public key should remain constant (same client identity across reconnects)
  - Mid-game disconnect recovery is acceptable even if game is abandoned - key is system recovers
  - Nonce continuity is managed server-side; test verifies transactions work, not nonce values
  - `Promise.race()` is useful for testing multiple message types (game_move vs game_result vs error)
  - Integration tests run via ts-node, not Jest: `ts-node tests/integration/runReconnectionTests.ts`

## 2026-01-06 - US-027: Fix mobile integration test message type mismatches

- What was implemented:
  - Verified all 10 game integration tests have correct message type expectations
  - Enhanced `waitForGameOutcome()` to also handle `error` messages for better diagnostics
  - Error messages are now captured and logged with full JSON content for debugging
  - Created `runSingleTest.ts` utility for quick single-game debugging
- Message type patterns verified:
  - **Atomic games** (Roulette, Craps, Baccarat, SicBo): Use `waitForGameOutcome()` directly - correct
  - **Multi-move games** (Blackjack, HiLo, VideoPoker, ThreeCard, UltimateHoldem): Use `game_started` then `waitForGameOutcome()` - correct
  - **Hybrid game** (CasinoWar): Uses `game_started` to check for immediate result or tie state - correct
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/tests/integration/framework/BaseGameTest.ts` - Enhanced `waitForGameOutcome()` to handle error messages
  - `mobile/tests/integration/runSingleTest.ts` - New utility for quick debugging
- **Learnings:**
  - Gateway returns `type: "error"` with `code` and `message` fields when operations fail
  - `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` error means session creation failed (backend connectivity issue)
  - Integration tests require functioning backend with proper session creation
  - `Promise.race()` with three message types (game_move, game_result, error) provides comprehensive outcome handling
  - Running full test suite with `npx tsx tests/integration/runTests.ts` (not ts-node)

## 2026-01-06 - US-028: Add chip betting balance validation tests

- What was implemented:
  - Added 4 new tests to `useChipBetting.test.tsx` (total now 8 tests)
  - Test: cumulative bet exceeding balance is rejected (place 2x25, then 3rd fails at balance=50)
  - Test: zero balance rejects all chip placements with `haptics.error()`
  - Test: fresh balance via `getState()` detects mid-betting balance updates
  - Test: balance correctly reflects store state changes
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/hooks/__tests__/useChipBetting.test.tsx` - Added 4 new balance validation tests
- **Learnings:**
  - Existing tests already covered basic over-balance rejection and `haptics.error()` calls
  - The gap was edge cases: cumulative bets, zero balance, and fresh balance validation
  - `useGameStore.getState().balance` in the hook ensures fresh value, not stale closure
  - Zustand `setState` inside tests must be wrapped in `act()` to avoid React warnings
  - UI disabled state is effectively tested through `placeChip()` returning `false` + `haptics.error()` trigger

## 2026-01-06 - US-029: Add corrupted protocol data tests

- What was implemented:
  - Created `packages/protocol/test/corrupted-data.test.ts` with 35 tests for protocol decoder robustness
  - Created `gateway/tests/unit/corrupted-events.test.ts` with 20 tests for gateway event decoder robustness
  - Protocol tests cover: truncated messages, extra bytes, invalid enum values, invalid UTF-8
  - Gateway tests cover: varint overflow attacks, truncated updates, invalid Vec lengths
- Files changed:
  - `packages/protocol/test/corrupted-data.test.ts` - New file with 35 tests
  - `gateway/tests/unit/corrupted-events.test.ts` - New file with 20 tests
- **Learnings:**
  - Protocol layer uses fixed-width decoding (DataView) while gateway uses BinaryReader with varint
  - Varint decoder already has overflow protection at `shift > 35` (line 266 in events.ts)
  - TextDecoder with default options replaces invalid UTF-8 with U+FFFD (replacement character)
  - Gateway's `extractCasinoEvents` has fallback scanning after structured decode fails
  - `ProtocolError` is the custom error class for decode failures in @nullspace/protocol
  - Pattern: Test both the "happy path" corruption (returns empty/null) and "explicit throw" cases
  - Boundary tests (max u64, max valid enum, zero-length) are valuable for catching off-by-one errors

## 2026-01-06 - US-030: Add crypto signing integration tests

- What was implemented:
  - Completely rewrote `crypto.test.ts` to use real `@noble/curves/ed25519` operations
  - Removed `jest.mock('@noble/curves/ed25519')` that was mocking all crypto operations
  - Added 26 tests in 5 categories using real cryptographic operations:
    - Signature generation (4 tests): 64-byte signatures, determinism, different keys/messages
    - Signature verification round-trip (6 tests): valid/invalid signatures, tampered data, empty/large messages
    - Key generation (4 tests): 32-byte keys, unique pairs, deterministic derivation
    - Hex encoding round-trip (2 tests): encode/decode, signing after serialization
    - Vault key export/import (8 tests): create/export, identity preservation, lock/unlock cycles
    - Cross-platform compatibility (2 tests): Ed25519 standard format, deterministic derivation
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/services/__tests__/crypto.test.ts` - Complete rewrite with real crypto operations
- **Learnings:**
  - `@noble/curves/ed25519` uses pure JavaScript implementation - no WASM dependency
  - Ed25519 signatures are deterministic: same key + message = same 64-byte signature
  - Signature structure: R (32 bytes) + S (32 bytes) = 64 bytes total
  - `webcrypto` from Node.js `crypto` module provides `crypto.getRandomValues` for tests
  - Vault uses XChaCha20-Poly1305 with PBKDF2 (250k iterations) for key encryption
  - Key export/import preserves identity: public key derived from private key is deterministic
  - Tests now validate real cryptographic operations rather than mocked behavior

## 2026-01-06 - US-031: Add useBetSubmission unit tests

- What was implemented:
  - Created `useBetSubmission.test.tsx` with 16 comprehensive unit tests
  - Tests cover all acceptance criteria: double-tap rejection, timeout recovery, clearSubmission, send failure
  - Tests organized into 5 describe blocks: double-tap rejection, timeout auto-recovery, clearSubmission, send failure, concurrent scenarios
  - Uses `jest.useFakeTimers()` for precise timeout testing
  - Custom `renderHook` helper follows codebase pattern from useChipBetting.test.tsx
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/hooks/__tests__/useBetSubmission.test.tsx` - New file with 16 tests
- **Learnings:**
  - When testing rapid-fire scenarios, each tap must be in separate `act()` calls for React to process state updates
  - `jest.useFakeTimers()` with `jest.advanceTimersByTime()` allows precise testing of timeout behavior
  - Pattern for timeout boundary testing: advance to 4999ms (still active), then 1ms more (should trigger)
  - `clearSubmission` should be safe to call multiple times - idempotent cleanup
  - Send failure should NOT set isSubmitting flag - allows immediate retry without waiting for timeout

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-032: Add server bet rejection tests

- What was implemented:
  - Created `BetRejectionHandling.test.tsx` with 14 comprehensive tests covering bet rejection scenarios
  - Tests organized into 6 describe blocks: error message handling, insufficient balance, below minimum bet, UI recovery, game in progress, backend errors
  - Tests verify `clearSubmission()` is called on error messages to re-enable DEAL button
  - Tests verify error messages are displayed to user (with fallback to "Action failed")
  - Tests verify sequential error messages update correctly
  - Tests cover all gateway error codes: INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE, INVALID_BET, GAME_IN_PROGRESS, BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE, NONCE_MISMATCH, TRANSACTION_REJECTED
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/screens/games/__tests__/BetRejectionHandling.test.tsx` - New file with 14 tests
- **Learnings:**
  - Gateway sends error responses as `{ type: 'error', code: ErrorCode, message: string }` format
  - Error codes defined in `gateway/src/types/errors.ts` - includes client errors (4xx) and backend errors (5xx)
  - `clearSubmission()` must be called on ANY error response to re-enable the DEAL button
  - BlackjackScreen uses `lastMessage.type === 'error'` to detect rejections (line 163-169)
  - Error message display: `lastMessage.message || 'Action failed'` provides fallback for missing message field
  - Mock pattern: Override `useBetSubmission` hook with controlled `isSubmitting` state using `jest.mock('../../../hooks/useBetSubmission')`
  - Test `mockIsSubmitting = true` then `false` to verify button disabled/enabled state transitions
  - All game screens share same error handling pattern (inherited from BlackjackScreen architecture)

---

## 2026-01-06 - US-033: Add balance race condition tests

- What was implemented:
  - Added 6 new tests in `balance race conditions` describe block to useChipBetting.test.tsx
  - Total tests now 14: 8 existing + 6 new race condition tests
  - Tests cover: balance update during betting, concurrent placements, balance decrease edge case, boundary condition, balance below bet, multiple balance updates
- Files changed:
  - `mobile/src/hooks/__tests__/useChipBetting.test.tsx` - Added 6 tests in new `balance race conditions` describe block
- **Learnings:**
  - Key pattern: `useGameStore.getState().balance` in useChipBetting.ts:56 fetches fresh balance at validation time
  - This avoids stale closure issue where balance captured at render time could be outdated
  - Edge case: If balance drops below current bet, additional chips correctly fail but bet stays (user must clear manually)
  - Boundary test: `bet + chip = balance` should succeed (using `>` not `>=` in comparison)
  - Test pattern: Each chip placement in separate `act()` call for proper React state batching
  - Zustand's `setState()` immediately updates store, allowing mid-test balance manipulation
