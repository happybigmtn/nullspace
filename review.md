When asked to BreakdownSprints:
If you were to break this project down into sprints and tasks, how would you do it (timeline info does not need to be included and doesn't matter) - every task/ticket should be an atomic, committable piece of work with tests (and if tests don't make sense, another form of validation that it was completed successfully). Every sprint should result in a demoable piece of software that can be run, tested, and build on top of previous work/sprints. Be exhaustive, be clear, be technical, always focus on small atomic tasks that compose up into a clear goal for the sprint. Once you're done, provide this prompt to a subagent to review your work and suggest improvements. When you're done reviewing the suggested improvements, write your tasks/tickets, sprint plans, etc., to the ralph/specs directory as markdown files, then implement those specs into Implementation Plan, following the guidance in ralphreadme.md
